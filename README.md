# DMAT
Cpp code for calculating cosmological dark matter densities of thermal relic DM candidate particles

Compilation and running instructions included in this README file. 


# Compilation
Recommend compiling using ubuntu terminal available on linux systems or through 'windows subsystem for linux' with windows 10. 
Requires installation of gsl libraries and g++ compiler.
To install GSL Libraries: $sudo apt-get install g++
Tp install compiler: $sudo apt-get install libgsl-dev

To compile: 

# Running Instructions
After compilation, run using bash: ./example

Code does not require input options and any variables should be changed directly within the .cpp file, keeping in mind to recompile after making any changes. 

# Notes
Documentation with background theory and deriavation of relevant equations, as well as output for specific conditions provided in 'DMATdoc.pdf'.
